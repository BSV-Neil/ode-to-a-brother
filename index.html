                    This site is dedicated to extolling the virtues of my brother, Mark. Sure, I could tell all sorts of "little brother" stories about him - like the time he spilled the whole pitcher of lemonade all over the kitchen floor! - but the reality is that he's the bestest brother on the planet. Read on to find out why.

                        Sometime in the early 90s: I got to keep an eye on you during the summers. That basically meant I dragged you everywhere with me and my friends. You took it pretty well (I think).

                        This site is dedicated to extolling the virtues of my brother, Mark. Sure, I could tell all sorts of "little brother" stories about him - like the time he spilled the whole pitcher of lemonade all over the kitchen floor! - but the reality is that he's the bestest brother on the planet. Read on to find out why.

                            Sometime in the early 80s: you were born, and I became your big sister. Hooray!

                        <li>
                            Sometime in the late 80s: you and Garrett perfected the art of scooter-racing the Hot Wheels.

                        <li>
                            Sometime in the early 90s: I got to keep an eye on you during the summers. That basically meant I dragged you everywhere with me and my friends. You took it pretty well (I think).

                            Sometime in the early 2010s: move where there are Waffle Houses. Move away from where there are Waffle Houses. Start transforming impressionable college-aged minds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sometime in the mid 2010s: help create not just one, but two little amazing people.
